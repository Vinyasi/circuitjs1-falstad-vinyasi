Added a dropdown menubar to Paul Falstad's Electronic Simulator for displaying my circuits in addition to his:

Since I'm not a programmer and don't fully appreciate the Java language, I can't finish all of my tweaks. The addition of a dropdown menubar highlighting my circuits focusing on electrical surges has been added to Paul's CirSim.java file. But these two circuit-listing, dropdown menubars -- his and mine -- randomly alternate their position relative to each other. Sometimes one is to the left of the other, sometimes they're reversed, every time the page loads into the browser. I suspect the architecture of their being written out to the browser's screen has to be restructered to accommodate multiple circuit listings? The best I can do is add my own, retain his, and assign unique titles/labels at the top of both.

Within the 'About' box, I added a link to here:

And a link to my website:

Added an image to the 'About' popup box to brand my site:

And added a 'Differential Equations' button to the upper right-hand corner of the simulator for a few circuits whose mathematical functions -- capable of plotting their waveforms -- has been reverse engineered, or hypothesized, from their oscilloscope readouts.
